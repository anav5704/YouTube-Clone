# YouTube Clone ðŸ“º

![Hero](https://github.com/anav5704/YouTube-Clone/blob/main/docs/youtube.png)

This is a simple recreation of YouTube. It has a sidebar with various categories and a search page that fetches data from a search endpoint on Rapid APIs YouTube API. This was my first time working with Rapid API and it was an ok experience. The free tier has a pretty low quota limit though and I exceeded it many times.

## Technologies Used
- React JS
- Material UI 5
- Rapid API

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. First run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project with the following variable(this is the Rapid API key - YouTube v3):

```
API_KEY
```

Once that is done, run ```npm start``` to view it on localhost.
